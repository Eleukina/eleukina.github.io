Good morning! How are you?

On Friday our teacher give us list of 10 different online games. And now I want to show you one of this game. It called Akinator. I think, all people know this game, but if you are like me don't know, then this post for you!

Now let's analyze game. 

### Rules of play

Think of a a popular character.  Akinator will ask you a series of questions. Answer them as frankly as possible. 
Then it will automatically ask if the character it chose is correct. 

### Winning condition

If the character is guessed wrong three times in a row, then you win and the program will ask the user to type the characterâ€™s name in order to expand its database.

P.s. At the start this game make me fun, but theeeen I was so angry! Because Akinator could guessed all of my words! But after multeply tries, I propose....Octocat! And I win!

### Story

A while ago, Arnaud and his friend Jeff had decided to go on a trip into the far away lands of the East. There they uncover an old oil lamp!

Jeff joked :
"I know! Pick three wishes and rub it, a genie might come out!"

After their third try,  dense smoke poured out of lamp and formed a small opaque cloud. Astonished, they saw a creature appear before them. It had the aspect of a man and looked quite friendly.

Then a grave voice rang out:

"Hello, I am the Akinator. You woke me up from a centuries-long sleep. I am capable of guessing who you are thinking about with a few questions. If I cannot, if you beat me, then I shall leave you alone. But be careful! Answer my questions accurately or... or you will take my place in the lamp."

Our two friends answered scrupulously the genie's questions and noted that he easily guessed who were the characters they had in mind. He was very proud of this deed and started to sing and talk, talk, talk... and never seemed to stop. He seemed to have inexhaustible energy. 

The two travellers tried to slip away. Yet the genie was still floating in the air behind them. And Jeff asked his friend:

"What are we going to do, Arnaud? He's following us everywhere. We'll never get rid of him!"

"We're going to bring him back to France. He wants to discover characters; then we'll give him what he wants."

Such Jeff and Arnaud create the website akinator.com.
