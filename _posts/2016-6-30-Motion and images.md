Motion graphics is a digital technique that combines images, words, sound and video.

Motion graphics combine the languages of film, animation and graphic design. Combining different creative elements like typography, 
image, logos, shapes and video. They are then animated or moved in a way that somebody tell them.

A great example of the simplest form of animation and motion graphics combined, is an animated GIF. Endless GIFs, they can be interesting 
loops of amazing animation, packed into a few seconds.
