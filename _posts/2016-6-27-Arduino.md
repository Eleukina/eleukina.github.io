Good morning! Today most of our time we spent working with Arduino. What is an Arduino? 

Arduino is an open-source platform used for building electronics projects. I think all that you can imagine you can do with Arduino! 
(If you don't believe me pls Google it!)

But now I want to share you with my works. 
- Firstly, I made lights which stay on line and bright in turn. You can see it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnWdAU8nC_Y)
 
- Secondly, I due to arduino we could make good melody. You can see it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZanwIxI4HYo)

- Thirdly, I made light which can change its color. You can see it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-zyeRNGy9Y)

- Fourthly, I made (again c: ) light which brightness depends on illumination. You can see it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azXOV3zaPos)

- Fifthly, I made light which switched on and off by button.

I hope, this works will inspirate you to make your own creative project!
