Good morning! Today most of our time we spent working with Arduino. What is an Arduino? 

Arduino is an open-source platform used for building electronics projects. I think all that you can imagine you can do with Arduino! 
(If you don't believe me pls Google it!)

But now I want to share you with my works. 
- Firstly, I made lights which stay on line and bright in turn.
- Secondly, I due to arduino we could make good melody.
- Thirdly, I made light which can change its color.
- Fourthly, I made (again c: ) light which brightness depends on illumination. 
- Fifthly, I made light which switched on and off by button.

I hope, this works will inspirate you to make your own creative project!
