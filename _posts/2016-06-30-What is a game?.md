Good morninng, guys! Now I wanto to talk about... games. 

Yeach, you think that you know what is a game, so pls answer me: What is a game? 

I think, your answer is like this: game is every activity that brings pleasure. But it is not correct. 

Game is:

### Rules of play

### Winning condition

### Story

So, if some activity that brings pleasure doesn't have one of this item, it is not a game. Let's make sure. For that, we should analyze 
any game. I pick Angre Bird.

### Rules of play

The goal in each level is to get rid of the pigs. The pigs are usually blocked by wood, glass, stone or another material 
arranged into creative structures. You will need to use the angry birds to get rid of both the obstacles and pigs.

### Winning condition

If you kill all pigs, you win.

### Story

One day pigs stole all birds eggs. And bird became angry and they want to return their eggs.

I hope, I could help you. Good buy!
