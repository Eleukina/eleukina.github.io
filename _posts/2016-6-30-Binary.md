All computers depend on a binary system of ones and zeros, and on rules of logic set out in the 1850s by English mathematician 
George Boole.

### What is binary system?

Binary is a base 2 number system invented by Gottfried Leibniz where numeric values are represented by different combinations of 0 and 1, 
also known as OFF or ON.

### Why do computers use binary?

- It is a simple and elegant design.

- Binary's 0 and 1 method is efficient at detecting an electrical signal's off or on state.

- The positive and negative poles magnetic media is quickly translated into binary.

- Binary is the most efficient way to control logic circuits.
