Good morning! Today is last day if my course :c. For that I want to thanks Duman agaya, because he help us with many important things as translate words and he help to make pixel arts. At the start we also had other english teacher Gulmira Zhylgeldinova. She helped us very much!

Also, I am very happy, that I have exactly this classmates. B/c there all students are very kind, funny and amazing! I think, there is not any student, who didn't help to others.
