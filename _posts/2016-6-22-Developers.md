Hello! In this post I want to talk you about developers(yeach, how you undertsand they make all games and apps). 

### Who are there?

Software developers (or computer programmers) are the brains behind the design, installation, testing and maintenance of software systems.

![_config.yml](https://www.oskyinteractive.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Software-Engineers-and-Developers.jpg)

There are different developers:

- producer

- designer

- engineer

- scientist

- artist

Let's talk about each of them!

### Producer

...or provider, manager. Producer supply other developers with things needed to create game. How do you think, can developers make any game without producers? Yes, you're right! It is impossible.

### Designer

Designer plan other workers.He or she design a game and make blueprints.For that designer job is too important.

### Engineer

...or builder.Engineer implement designer's ideas.And it is important and difficult to program game.

### Scientist

Oh!Scientist have so interesting, but hard job.She or he must make hypothesis about future of game or app.And they help to know will be certain app or game popular or not.Should developers create this game or not.Without scientist deveelopers can work in vain.

### Artist

Artist have to make games view.Him or her work is not so hard, but it more appreciated by users.Artists attract attention to game and make it more beautiful and interesting.

To conclusion,I want to say about my choice. Who I want to be in future? If someone ask me this question I answeer engineer.Because I think, that this job is more suitable for me than others. Because, for me this job is much more interesting and it make me develop on regular basic.
