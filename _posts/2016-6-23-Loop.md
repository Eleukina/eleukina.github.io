Hello for everybody! How are you?
Today in course our teacher introduced us with one cute program. It called Processing.org. 

![_config.yml]({www.creativeapplications.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/processing00.png)

There people can can draw all that they want!

And I due to this program can create my own monster! He is so pretty. I love him ^-^.

( P.S. you can see him on this page https://eleukina.github.io/monster )

Have a nice day!
