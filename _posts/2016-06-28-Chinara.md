Hi for everybody! Today morning we introduced with very kind and nice technology manager Chinara Satkeeva from Kyrgzystan. 

Before she has worked for 5 year in bank. But now she works in Google.  At the start she want to work on search group in finans field. But, she works on program that help us to watch films in Internet. And a lot of popular film companies use this program. It is about her job.

I think, most of you are confused: Why title of this post is about inspiration? Let me explain.

Chinara Satkeeeva is not as other people who connect their life with computer science. She has 3 higher education(that is cool!) but she never study about programming, computer or something connecting with this. But now she works in one of the most popular and famous company in the world. 

She could achiev it by perseverance, effort and … communication skills. Yeach, she started to interest in and could learn about computer science by communication and friends(but not forget that she is from Kyrgystan) and she could work in gooogle due to 2 year preparing, when others prepare for all of their life and can’t do it.

She help me to understand that we should always communicate and if we want we can do anything.

So, I want to thanks Chinara Satkeeva for her answers and advices!
