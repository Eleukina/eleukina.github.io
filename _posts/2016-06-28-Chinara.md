title: My inspiration is Chinara
---

Hi for everybody! Today morning we introduced with very kind and nice technology manager Chinara Satkeeva from Kyrzystan. 

Now she works in Google.But before she has worked for 5 year in bank. At the start she want to work on search group in finans field. But now she works on program that help us to watch films in Internet. And a lot of popular film companies use this program. It was a little bit about her job.

I think, most of you are confused: Why title of this post is about inspiration? Let me explain.

Chinara Satkeeeva is not as other people who connect their life with computer science. She has 3  higher education(that is cool!)  but she never study about programming, computer or something connecting with this. But now she works on one of the most popular and famous company in the world. She could achiev it by  perseverance, effort and ... communication skills. Yeach, she started to interest in and could learn about computer science by communication and friends(but not forget that she is from Kyrgystan) and she could work in gooogle due to 2 only year prepaaring, when others prepaare for all of their life and can't do it. 

So, I want to thanks Chinara Satkeeva for her answers and advices!

P.s. her advices:

- Be googley!
- 
- Support communication with peoople.
- 
- Don't use people.
- 
- Ask advices from more experienced peoople.
