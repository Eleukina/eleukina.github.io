Hello! On previous post I wrotten about processig program. And in this post I, also, write about animations from this program.

At the start when me and my class understood how to do animations, we began to experiment with different figures and values. Every time we made somthing beautiful and different! And I want to share my animations with you. You can see them on this [link](https://eleukina.github.io/animation/) .
