Hello for everybody! How are you?

Today in course our teacher introduced us with one cute program. It called Processing.org. 

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/17794_22434_9649.png)

There people can can draw all that they want!

And I due to this program can create my own monster! He is so pretty. I love him ^-^.
