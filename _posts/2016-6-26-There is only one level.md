Good evening, guys! Now I make review for one more game from previous list (I said about it on previous post). It named There is Only One Level. 

At the start it is too hard to play, but then this game will tighten you! In There is Only One Level you should:

- Firstly, think how to move and control elephant(main character). Because there is one level (location don't change), but different stages. On each stage there different control c:

- Secondly, try to win stage of level.

Now, as always, I write rules, winning condition and story of this game.

### Rules of play:

You have to help elephant to finish stage. But you should be ready for different controls.

### Winning condition:

If you can beat only 1 level, you win.

### Story:

The elephant forgot the rest of the levels, but luckily he still has one left! Help him beat it in all his metagaming glory. 

I hope, I make you interested in this game. So, play it [there](http://www.onemorelevel.com/game/there_is_only_one_level).
